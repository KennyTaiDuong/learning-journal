        <h1>Hi There! My name is Kenny and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
        <p>
          After high school, I was still unsure on which career path I wanted to
          pursue. At first, I went to college for a bachelor's degree in
          finance, and quickly realized college was not for me and decided to
          chase a career in web development.

        <h3>Why I chose web development</h3>
        <p>
          After a few years of running a reselling business, it showed me how
          impactful a website can be for resellers. This opened my eyes to the
          benefits of learning how to code, along with the fact that, technology
          has been an evolving industry for the past few decades with new
          creations coming out every year.
        </p>
        <p>
          With little to no interest in college, I knew getting a degree was
          completely out the window, so I thought it was best for me to invest
          my time in developing a skill that I can turn into a career. Besides
          technology, I could have taken the union route, but I didn't want to
          work a hard-labor job that tore my body down and possibly could have
          seriously injured myself.
        </p>
        <h3>How I plan to use my skills</h3>
        <p>
          After gaining all the skills I need to build websites, I plan on
          searching for jobs to keep me busy during the day and earn a stable
          income. With my time outside of work, I would be researching how I can
          use my skills to create side-hustles or even my own business.
