          My new journey as a self-taught web developer
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-subtitle">
          After a poor performance in college, I decided to become a college
          drop-out and search for a career in the tech industry. With the
          consistent growth of technology, I believed there were only positives
          in entering this field.

        <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
        <p>
          Fortunately, I have relatives who were already in this space and were
          willing to support and guide me along my journey to find a career.
          Through their support, I was given the opportunity to move to a
          different state and put myself in an environment where I would study
          like it was my full-time job. This studying structure allowed me to
          spend majority of my week learning how to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only downside was that I had to sacrifice my time with family and
          friends in my hometown. Initially, I was feeling homesick, but after a
          few months it all went away.
        </p>
        <h3>How I got started</h3>
        <p>
          Initially, I had the intentions of becoming a backend-developer, so I
          began learning how to write Python through an open Harvard course,
          "CS50P". That took me about a month to get through and learn the
          basics of Python. After the course, I felt like I needed to learn more
          of the fundamentals, so I went back to learn a more general comp-sci
          course, "CS50." After going through majority of the course and working
          a little on the frontend languages, I enjoyed it more and decided to
          switch career goals to frontend developer. Now, I am here learning
          frontend languages through Scrimba working on this solo project.
